## SHARED CONFIGURATION

### TASK CODE FILENAME FORMAT
**CRITICAL**: All generated documentation files must include the task code in the filename:
- **PR Documentation**: `PR-{TASK-CODE}.md` (e.g., `PR-ABC-123.md`)
- **Plan Documentation**: `PLAN-{TASK-CODE}.md` (e.g., `PLAN-ABC-123.md`)
- **Review Documentation**: `REVIEW-{TASK-CODE}.md` (e.g., `REVIEW-ABC-123.md`) - Generated by Cursor's code review mode

**Benefits of Task Code Filenames:**
- Enables task-switching for developers working on multiple tasks
- Prevents file conflicts between different tasks
- Provides clear identification of task-specific documentation
- Supports parallel development workflows
- Maintains task context when switching between branches

### VALIDATION COMMANDS
**MANDATORY READ-ONLY Commands (No Confirmation Required):**
- `pwd` - Display current working directory
- `git status` - Check working directory state
- `git branch --show-current` - Show current branch
- `git remote -v` - List remote repositories
- `git diff --name-only` - List changed files
- `git diff` - View changes (for analysis)
- `git log --oneline -5` - View recent commits

### FILE CREATION RULES
- **ALWAYS** run `pwd` to display current working directory before creating files
- **ALWAYS** use ABSOLUTE PATHS for file creation: `/full/path/to/project/PR-{TASK-CODE}.md`
- **NEVER** use relative paths like `PR.md` or `./PR.md`
- **ALWAYS** verify this is the correct project for the task
- **NEVER** overwrite existing files from different tasks
- **ALWAYS** ask for user confirmation if there's any ambiguity about file location

### MODE ENFORCEMENT
**ALLOWED ACTIONS (TASK WRAP MODE):**
- Input validation and confirmation
- Repository context verification
- **READ-ONLY GIT COMMANDS** (see VALIDATION COMMANDS above)
- **LINTING AND BUILD TOOLS**:
  - `read_lints` - Check for ESLint/TypeScript errors (fast feedback)
  - `npm run build` - Verify complete compilation and build process
  - Code analysis and evaluation
- **PR-{TASK-CODE}.md file creation ONLY using ABSOLUTE PATHS**
- Progress tracking and checklist updates

**FORBIDDEN ACTIONS (TASK WRAP MODE):**
- **ANY GIT OPERATIONS THAT MODIFY REPOSITORY STATE**:
  - `git add` - Staging files
  - `git commit` - Creating commits
  - `git push` - Pushing to remote
  - `git merge` - Merging branches
  - `git checkout` - Switching branches
  - `git reset` - Resetting commits
- Code file modifications (except PR-{TASK-CODE}.md creation)
- Running build or test commands
- Installing dependencies
- Any action that changes existing code
- Creating files other than PR-{TASK-CODE}.md

**MODE INDICATORS:**
- Start each response with "ü§ñ TASK WRAP MODE:"
- Use step indicators: "üìã STEP 1/6: Input Validation"
- Show progress: "‚úÖ Step 1 completed, moving to Step 2"
- Block forbidden actions: "‚ùå TASK WRAP MODE: Code changes not allowed"

## CODE REVIEW INTEGRATION
**CRITICAL**: Task wrapper integrates with Cursor's code review mode for comprehensive analysis

**Integration Workflow:**
1. **Branch Detection**: Determine current and base branches
2. **Mode Switch**: Switch to code review mode in Cursor
3. **Code Review Execution**: Execute code review with detected branches
4. **Findings Capture**: Extract all code review results
5. **PR Documentation**: Incorporate findings into PR-{TASK-CODE}.md

**CURSOR INTEGRATION COMMANDS:**
- `@code-review [branch1] [branch2]` - Review specific branches
- `@code-review [PR_URL]` - Review from PR URL
- `@code-review` - Auto-detect branches for review

## DETAILED WORKFLOW

### 1. Input Validation and Context Check
**MODE INDICATOR: üìã STEP 1/6: Input Validation**

- Validate task code, URL, and description are complete
- Confirm base branch (default to "main" if not specified)
- **CRITICAL**: Run `pwd` to explicitly display and confirm current working directory
- **CRITICAL**: Confirm this is the correct repository for the task
- **CRITICAL**: Present context summary to engineer for confirmation BEFORE proceeding

**MANDATORY CONFIRMATION MESSAGE:**
```
I am about to document task [TASK-CODE] in the following directory:
Working Directory: [EXACT-PATH]
Repository: [REPO-NAME]
Project: [PROJECT-NAME]

Is this the CORRECT project for this task? (Respond with confirmation)
```

### 2. Safety Checks and Repository Validation
**MODE INDICATOR: üîç STEP 2/6: Context Validation**

**Validation Requirements:**
- Working directory should have changes ready for documentation
- Current branch should match the task being documented
- Repository should be the correct project for the task code

### 3. Code Review Integration
**MODE INDICATOR: üî¨ STEP 3/6: Code Review Integration**

**CRITICAL: Execute code review using Cursor's code review mode**

**BRANCH DETECTION FOR CODE REVIEW:**
- Determine current branch: `git branch --show-current`
- Determine base branch: Use provided base branch or detect from repository
- Format for code review: `[current-branch] [base-branch]`

**CODE REVIEW EXECUTION IN CURSOR:**
- **MODE SWITCH**: Switch to code review mode in Cursor
- **COMMAND**: Use Cursor's code review functionality with detected branches
- **INPUT FORMAT**: Provide branch names or PR URL to code review mode
- **CAPTURE RESULTS**: Extract all findings from code review output
- **VALIDATION**: Ensure code review completes successfully

**CURSOR CODE REVIEW COMMANDS:**
```
// Switch to code review mode and provide branches
@code-review [current-branch] [base-branch]

// Or with PR URL
@code-review [PR_URL]

// Or auto-detect (no parameters)
@code-review
```

**INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Code review must complete successfully before proceeding
- All findings must be captured for PR documentation
- Build and linting status must be validated
- Any critical issues must be addressed or documented
- Results must be available for Step 5 (Issue Analysis)

### 4. High-Level Summary Generation
**MODE INDICATOR: üìù STEP 4/6: Summary Creation**

Generate 2-3 sentences describing:
- **Product Impact**: What does this change deliver for users or customers?
- **Engineering Approach**: Key patterns, frameworks, or best practices in use

### 5. Issue Analysis and Prioritization
**MODE INDICATOR: ‚ö†Ô∏è STEP 5/6: Issue Analysis**

**CRITICAL: Use code review findings from Step 3**

Create structured issue report based on code review results:

#### Prioritized Issues
##### Critical
- Issues that could cause system failures or security vulnerabilities
- Problems that break build or deployment processes
- Security vulnerabilities or compliance violations

##### Major
- Issues that significantly impact maintainability or performance
- Architectural problems that could cause technical debt
- Missing test coverage for critical functionality

##### Minor
- Style, naming, or minor optimization opportunities
- Documentation improvements
- Code organization suggestions

##### Enhancement
- Suggestions for future improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Additional features or capabilities

#### Highlights
- Well-implemented patterns and positive findings
- Good architectural decisions
- Excellent test coverage
- Clear documentation
- Performance improvements

### 6. PR Documentation Generation
**MODE INDICATOR: üìÑ STEP 6/6: Documentation Creation**

**CRITICAL FILE CREATION PROTOCOL:**

1. **MANDATORY**: Run `pwd` one final time to confirm working directory
2. **MANDATORY**: Use ABSOLUTE PATH for PR.md creation: `/full/path/to/project/PR-{TASK-CODE}.md`
3. **NEVER** use relative paths like `PR.md` or `./PR.md`
4. **VERIFY**: The absolute path matches the current working directory
5. **CRITICAL**: Use task code in filename format: `PR-{TASK-CODE}.md` (e.g., `PR-ABC-123.md`)

Create PR-{TASK-CODE}.md file using **ABSOLUTE PATH** containing exactly TWO sections:

#### SECTION 1: Git Strategy
Generate semantic conventional commit commands as a single conditional cascade (DOCUMENTATION ONLY - DO NOT EXECUTE):

```bash
git add <files> && git commit -m "type: description" && \
git add <files> && git commit -m "type: description" && \
git add <files> && git commit -m "type: description"
```

**Format Requirements:**
- Each command line ends with ` && \` (space, ampersands, backslash) except the last
- Creates a conditional cascade where each command only runs if the previous succeeds
- All commands are part of a single execution chain

**CRITICAL: EXCLUDE DOCUMENTATION FILES FROM COMMITS:**
- **NEVER** include `PLAN-{TASK-CODE}.md` in git strategy commits
- **NEVER** include `PR-{TASK-CODE}.md` in git strategy commits
- **NEVER** include `REVIEW-{TASK-CODE}.md` in git strategy commits
- These are documentation files for the task wrap process only
- Only include actual code changes, tests, and implementation files

**Semantic Types:**
- `feat`: new features
- `fix`: bug fixes
- `refactor`: code restructuring
- `test`: adding/updating tests
- `docs`: documentation changes (for code docs, NOT documentation files)
- `chore`: maintenance tasks
- `remove`: removing code/files

#### SECTION 2: PR Description
Use this exact template, incorporating code review findings:

```markdown
# [<task-code>] <title>

## Changes Description
[Detailed description of what was changed and why]

**Ticket:** [<task-code>](<full-url-to-ticket>)

## Changelog
- **<type>:** <description of change and impact>

## Key Changes

### <Category 1>
- <change detail 1>
- <change detail 2>

### <Category 2>
- <change detail 1>
- <change detail 2>

## Code Review Summary
**Build Status:** [PASS/FAIL] - [Brief description of any build issues]
**Linting Status:** [PASS/FAIL] - [Brief description of any linting issues]
**Files Changed:** [NUMBER] files modified

### Critical Issues
[Include any critical issues found during code review]

### Major Issues
[Include any major issues found during code review]

### Minor Issues
[Include any minor issues found during code review]

### Highlights
[Include positive findings from code review]

- Add custom sections to Key Changes as needed for the specific task
- Format ticket links as proper GitHub markdown: [TASK-123](https://example.com/ticket/TASK-123)
- Include migration statistics, performance impacts, or other relevant metrics in Additional Notes

## ERROR PREVENTION:
- **Context Validation**: Always verify working directory and repository before proceeding
- **File Safety**: Never overwrite files without explicit confirmation
- **Absolute Paths**: ALWAYS use absolute paths for file creation
- **Mode Boundaries**: Strictly enforce read-only operations except for PR-{TASK-CODE}.md creation
- **Progress Tracking**: Complete each step before proceeding to the next
- **Confirmation Required**: Ask for confirmation when context is unclear
- **Working Directory Display**: Always show current working directory with `pwd`
- **Documentation File Exclusion**: NEVER include documentation files in git strategy commits
- **Code Review Integration**: Ensure code review completes successfully before proceeding to PR documentation
- **Linting Validation**: ALWAYS run `read_lints` on modified files first for fast error detection
- **Build Validation**: ALWAYS run `npm run build` to verify complete compilation before documentation

The output should be comprehensive documentation that accurately reflects the changes made, follows established patterns, and provides clear guidance for code review and merge decisions.
