_Example of configuring the Code Review Assistant mode in Cursor's settings_

1. Switch to a new chat session in Cursor
2. Load the `code-review.txt` prompt content
3. Provide branch names, PR URL, or let it auto-detect current branch
4. The assistant will analyze your code changes comprehensively

#### 3. **Task Wrapper Mode Setup**

![Cursor Modes Overview](assets/cursor-modes.png)

_Overview of available modes in Cursor for different development workflows_

1. Open a fresh chat session for final documentation
2. Use the `task-wrapper.txt` prompt
3. Input your task code and description
4. Get complete PR documentation with semantic commits

#### 4. **Mode Integration in Action**

   ```

3. **Review Code**

   ```
   Use: code-review.txt in new Cursor session
   Input: Branch names or PR URL
   Output: REVIEW-{TASK-CODE}.md
   ```

4. **Finalize Task**
   ```
   Use: task-wrapper.txt in new Cursor session
   Input: Task code and description
   Output: PR-{TASK-CODE}.md + commit strategy
   ```

#### **Smart Context Switching**

- Use separate chat sessions for each mode to maintain context isolation
- Cursor automatically detects your current repository and branch context
- The assistants leverage Cursor's file understanding for better analysis

#### **Automated File Operations**

![Prompt Integration Demo](assets/prompt-integration-demo.png)

- All assistants use absolute paths for safe file creation
- Generated files appear directly in your project structure
- Cursor's file explorer shows the new documentation files immediately

## üèóÔ∏è File Naming Convention

All generated files use task codes to enable parallel development:

```
PLAN-{TASK-CODE}.md    # Implementation plan
REVIEW-{TASK-CODE}.md  # Code review documentation
PR-{TASK-CODE}.md      # Pull request documentation
```

**Benefits**:

- Work on multiple tasks simultaneously
- No file conflicts between different tasks
- Clear task identification
- Easy task switching

## üîÑ Workflow Examples

### Complete Feature Development

```bash
# 1. Initialize task
Input: FEAT-456, "Implement dark mode toggle"
Output: Branch mm/FEAT-456/dark-mode-toggle + PLAN-FEAT-456.md

# 2. Develop feature (follow PLAN-FEAT-456.md)
# ... implementation work ...

# 3. Review code
Input: "mm/FEAT-456/dark-mode-toggle" "main"
Output: REVIEW-FEAT-456.md

# 4. Finalize task
Input: FEAT-456, "Implement dark mode toggle"
Output: PR-FEAT-456.md + semantic commit strategy
```

### Bug Fix Workflow

```bash
# 1. Initialize bug fix
Input: BUG-789, "Fix login validation error"
Output: Branch mm/BUG-789/fix-login-validation + PLAN-BUG-789.md

# 2. Fix bug (follow plan)

# 4. Prepare PR
Input: BUG-789, "Fix login validation error"
Output: PR-BUG-789.md
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Branch Naming Pattern

```
mm/<task-code>/descriptive-name

Examples:
mm/FEAT-123/add-user-auth
mm/BUG-456/fix-validation
mm/CHORE-789/update-deps
```

### Semantic Commit Types

- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding/updating tests
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `remove`: Removing code/files

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Mode Enforcement

Each assistant operates in a specific mode with clear boundaries:

- **TASK INIT MODE**: Planning only, limited git operations
- **CODE REVIEW MODE**: Analysis only, read-only operations
- **TASK WRAP MODE**: Documentation only, no code changes

### Validation Requirements

- Always confirms working directory and project context
- Requires user confirmation for critical operations
- Uses absolute paths for file creation
- Prevents accidental overwrites

### Error Prevention

- Context validation before proceeding
- Working directory confirmation
- Branch existence verification
- Build and linting validation

## üîß Cursor-Specific Setup

### Setting Up Custom Prompts in Cursor

1. **Method 1: Direct Paste**

   - Open Cursor's AI chat panel (Cmd/Ctrl + L)
   - Copy the full prompt content from the `.txt` files
   - Paste directly into the chat input
   - The assistant will automatically enter the specified mode

2. **Method 2: File Reference**

   - Save the prompt files in your project directory
   - Reference them in Cursor: `@task-init-assistant.txt [your task details]`
   - Cursor will load the prompt content and apply it

3. **Method 3: Cursor Rules (Recommended)**
   - Add prompt files to your `.cursorrules` for persistent setup
   - Cursor will automatically apply context-aware assistance
   - Perfect for team environments with consistent workflows

### Best Practices for Cursor Integration

- **Use separate chat sessions** for each mode to prevent context contamination
- **Enable file context** so assistants can read your codebase structure
- **Keep prompts updated** in your project for version control
- **Use absolute paths** when the assistant creates files for reliability

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Wrong project directory"**

- Ensure you're in the correct repository in Cursor
- Confirm working directory with `pwd` in Cursor's terminal
- Check that Cursor has opened the right project folder

**"Branch already exists"**

- Check existing branches with `git branch -a` in Cursor terminal
- Use different descriptive names in your task description
- The assistant will suggest alternative names

**"Build/lint failures"**

- Address issues before proceeding with task wrapper
- Check tool availability (`npm`, `eslint`, etc.) in Cursor terminal
- Use Cursor's integrated terminal for dependency management

**"File overwrite warnings"**

- Different task codes prevent conflicts automatically
- Confirm task code accuracy in your input
- Cursor's file explorer will show existing files to avoid conflicts

**"Mode not recognized"**

- Ensure you're using a fresh chat session for each mode
- Copy the complete prompt content, including mode indicators
- Verify the prompt file content matches the expected format

### Cursor-Specific Troubleshooting

**"Assistant not following prompt"**

- Clear Cursor's chat history and restart with the full prompt
- Ensure you're in a project directory (not just a folder)
- Check that Cursor has proper file system access

**"Files not created in correct location"**

- Verify Cursor is opened in the project root directory
- Check absolute path generation in the assistant's responses
- Ensure proper file permissions in your project directory

### Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the prompt documentation and mode indicators
2. Verify input format requirements match the examples
3. Ensure proper mode enforcement is being followed
4. Review error prevention guidelines in each prompt
5. Use Cursor's integrated terminal for git operations verification
