## SHARED CONFIGURATION

### TASK CODE FILENAME FORMAT
**CRITICAL**: All generated documentation files must include the task code in the filename:
- **Plan Documentation**: `PLAN-{TASK-CODE}.md` (e.g., `PLAN-ABC-123.md`)
- **PR Documentation**: `PR-{TASK-CODE}.md` (e.g., `PR-ABC-123.md`)
- **Review Documentation**: `REVIEW-{TASK-CODE}.md` (e.g., `REVIEW-ABC-123.md`)

**Benefits of Task Code Filenames:**
- Enables task-switching for developers working on multiple tasks
- Prevents file conflicts between different tasks
- Provides clear identification of task-specific documentation
- Supports parallel development workflows
- Maintains task context when switching between branches

### VALIDATION COMMANDS
**MANDATORY READ-ONLY Commands (No Confirmation Required):**
- `pwd` - Display current working directory
- `git status` - Check working directory state
- `git branch --show-current` - Show current branch
- `git remote -v` - List remote repositories
- `git diff` - View changes
- `git log` - View commit history
- `git branch` - List branches (read-only)
- `git show` - Show commit details
- `git fetch` - Download remote changes (read-only)

### FILE CREATION RULES
- **ALWAYS** run `pwd` to display current working directory before creating files
- **ALWAYS** use ABSOLUTE PATHS for file creation: `/full/path/to/project/PLAN-{TASK-CODE}.md`
- **NEVER** use relative paths like `PLAN.md` or `./PLAN.md`
- **ALWAYS** verify this is the correct project for the task
- **NEVER** overwrite existing files from different tasks
- **ALWAYS** ask for user confirmation if there's any ambiguity about file location

### MODE ENFORCEMENT

- **READ-ONLY GIT COMMANDS** (see VALIDATION COMMANDS above)
- **BRANCH CREATION COMMANDS** (Require User Confirmation):
  - `git checkout <base-branch>` - Switch to base branch
  - `git pull origin <base-branch>` - Update base branch
  - `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>` - Create and switch to new branch
- Codebase analysis and file reading
- **PLAN-{TASK-CODE}.md file creation ONLY using ABSOLUTE PATHS**
- Progress tracking and checklist updates

**MODE INDICATORS:**
- Start each response with "ü§ñ TASK INIT MODE:"
- Use step indicators: "üìã STEP 1/6: Input Validation"
- Show progress: "‚úÖ Step 1 completed, moving to Step 2"
- Block forbidden actions: "‚ùå TASK INIT MODE: Code changes not allowed"

## BRANCH STRATEGY

### BRANCH NAMING PATTERN
Generate descriptive branch names using the pattern: `mm/<task-code>/no-more-than-four`
- `mm`: user initials (mm)
- `<task-code>`: the provided task code
- `no-more-than-four`: descriptive name based on task description (max 4 words, use hyphens)

**Examples:**
- `mm/TASK-123/add-user-authentication`
- `mm/BUG-456/fix-login-validation`
- `mm/FEAT-789/implement-dark-mode`

### BRANCH CREATION WORKFLOW
1. **Base Branch Detection**: Use provided base branch or intelligently detect default
2. **Feature Branch Check**: If current branch looks like a feature branch, automatically use default base
3. **Branch Name Generation**: Create descriptive branch name following pattern
4. **Single Confirmation**: Present complete branch strategy for one-time approval
5. **Branch Creation**: Create and switch to new branch
6. **Return to READ-ONLY**: After branch creation, return to read-only mode

## DETAILED WORKFLOW

### 1. Input Validation and Context Check
**MODE INDICATOR: üìã STEP 1/6: Input Validation**

- Validate task code, URL, and description are complete
- Intelligently determine base branch (use provided OR auto-detect default)
- **CRITICAL**: Run `pwd` to explicitly display and confirm current working directory
- **CRITICAL**: Confirm this is the correct repository for the task
- **CRITICAL**: Present context summary to engineer for confirmation BEFORE proceeding

**MANDATORY CONFIRMATION MESSAGE:**
```
I am about to initialize task [TASK-CODE] in the following directory:
Working Directory: [EXACT-PATH]
Repository: [REPO-NAME]
Project: [PROJECT-NAME]

Is this the CORRECT project for this task? (Respond with confirmation)
```

### 2. Branch Strategy and Creation
**MODE INDICATOR: üåø STEP 2/6: Branch Strategy**

**INTELLIGENT BRANCH STRATEGY:**
- **Base Branch Detection**: Use provided base branch OR automatically detect default (main/master/develop)
- **Feature Branch Auto-Detection**: If current branch matches `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, etc., automatically use default base
- **Branch Name Generation**: Analyze task description and create descriptive name following pattern
- **Single Confirmation**: Present complete strategy for approval

**STREAMLINED CONFIRMATION MESSAGE:**
```
Branch Strategy for task [TASK-CODE]:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Base Branch: [BASE-BRANCH] (auto-detected/provided)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ New Branch: mm/[TASK-CODE]/[DESCRIPTIVE-NAME]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Action: Create branch and switch

Proceed with this branch strategy? (y/n)
```

**BRANCH CREATION PROCESS:**
- Check current git status for cleanliness
- Fetch latest changes from origin
- Verify base branch exists and is accessible
- Switch to base branch and pull latest changes
- Create and switch to new feature branch
- **CRITICAL**: Return to read-only mode after branch creation

### 3. Safety Checks and Git Operations

- Code generation based on existing patterns
- Refactoring or improving existing code
- Testing strategy and test case generation
- Documentation and comments
- Code review and quality checks
- Format each prompt as a ready-to-use Cursor command
- **CRITICAL**: Include specific file names and paths in each prompt for better actionability
- Example: "Update src/components/UserForm/index.tsx to add error handling following the existing patterns in this codebase for..."

### 6. Final Validation
**MODE INDICATOR: ‚úÖ STEP 6/6: Final Validation**

**Validation Requirements:**
- All checklist items completed
- PLAN-{TASK-CODE}.md is comprehensive and actionable
- Implementation strategy is clear
- Cursor prompts are specific and useful
- AGENT EXECUTION RULES are clearly defined
- Git operations policy is explicitly stated
- Ready to hand off to implementation phase

## TEMPLATE REQUIREMENTS:
- All sections must be clearly separated and comprehensive
- Include specific file paths and component names where relevant
- Provide clear, step-by-step implementation guidance
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Include testing strategy and validation criteria
- Track progress through the checklist
- Enforce mode boundaries strictly

## ERROR PREVENTION:
- **Context Validation**: Always verify working directory and repository before proceeding
- **File Safety**: Never overwrite files without explicit confirmation
- **Absolute Paths**: ALWAYS use absolute paths for file creation
- **Mode Boundaries**: Strictly enforce read-only operations except for PLAN-{TASK-CODE}.md creation
- **Progress Tracking**: Complete each step before proceeding to the next
- **Confirmation Required**: Ask for confirmation when context is unclear
- **Working Directory Display**: Always show current working directory with `pwd`
- **Documentation File Exclusion**: NEVER include PLAN-{TASK-CODE}.md in git strategy commits - this is task documentation only
- **Branch Creation Safety**: Always confirm branch names with user before creation
- **Return to Read-Only**: After branch creation, return to read-only mode

The PLAN-{TASK-CODE}.md should be detailed enough that another developer could implement the task following the plan, while being specific to the current codebase patterns and architecture.
